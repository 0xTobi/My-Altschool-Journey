The useContext hook allows us to manage state globally. e.g. authenticated user, theme, preferred language.
Use useContext when you have a global state that will be used in a lot of components.

Basically context is for passing down props all the way down to any of the children without having to explicitly pass the prop to every single children.

For instance, we will have to pass the value prop to every component that needs it like so.
    
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    <FunctionComponent value={darkTheme}/>
    <ClassComponent value={darkTheme}/>
